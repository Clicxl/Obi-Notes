[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) is [[CSS]] wrapper that help build responsive mobile first UI with just class injection.

### Major Layout Styles
There are 2 sections in the UI/UX layout template:
1. Mobile: The mobile components generally take up the whole screen width to display it elements. Its either a `1x1` or a `2x1` layout. Rarely a `3x1` or higher is seen as it is unreadable or bad UX in general.
2. Desktop or Large Screens: They are generally `1x1` or `2x1` .. `4x1`. These larger screens are again divided into 2 types:
- Equal Sections: were every component takes up equal part on the screen.
- Unequal Sections: were the components are unevenly sized in the row.


### Note
- If a layout is built using grid like the navbar or anything else then the grid is divided into 12 rows, thats a design standard (not mandatory).
